Icons-Project
=============

Icon's for tukui rainmeter theme; a blend of MetroUI style and Token icons into a tukui themed icon package. Some I have had to create using other resources which are included in the resources folder. If you have requests don't hesitate to let me know.

This is a resource for tukui rainmeter theme in development by Hydra, not the icons Hydra is guaranteed to include in his theme. Some user input will be required to use the icons you want. I'll include a readme once his theme is complete explaining how to use these icons.
