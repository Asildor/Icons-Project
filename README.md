Icons-Project
=============

How-to:
1. Open the base .psd (resources/base.psd)
2. Open the style .psd (resources/style.psd)
3. Place your template icon, or whatever icon you wish to use, onto the base (File > Place...)
	- I used metro for the majority of the icons, some of the custom ones I used images from the resources folder.
4. Cut the icon out (pen tool, magic wand, your choice)
5. Copy the layer style from the style .psd and paste onto the icon layer
6. Select both layers, right click and convert to smart object
7. Image > Image Size > 23x23
8. 	Filter > Sharpen > Smart Sharpen and fiddle with the settings until it looks ok
9. File > Save for web and devices...
10. Voila!

Icon's for tukui rainmeter theme; a blend of MetroUI style and Token icons into a tukui themed icon package. Some I have had to create using other resources which are included in the resources folder. If you have requests don't hesitate to let me know.

This is a resource for tukui rainmeter theme in development by Hydra, not the icons Hydra is guaranteed to include in his theme. Some user input will be required to use the icons you want. I'll include a text tutorial once his theme is complete explaining how to use these icons.
